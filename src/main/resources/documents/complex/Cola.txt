Cola



Cola is a type of carbonated drink that was made from the kola nut in the past, although other foods are often used now. Coca-Cola and Pepsi are types of cola. 120 years ago, only 9 glasses of cola were sold each day, but now, around 14 million cola drinks are drunk in the world every day.



Cola is usually made cold in a fridge, so it can be more refreshing, and helps to retain its fizziness. Cola used to contain cocaine from the coca leaf, but that was removed in 1886.
