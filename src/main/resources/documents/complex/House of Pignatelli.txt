============================================================

The House of Pignatelli is the name an old and prominent Neapolitan family of Italian nobility, clergy, men of arts and sciences, whose members occupied significant positions in 18th and 19th century. The family has been regionally prominent since the 13th century. Among various titles, they held the title of Prince of the Holy Roman Empire.


== History ==
A member of the family, Antonio Pignatelli (1615-1700) was pope with the name of Pope Innocent XII. They were Princes of the Holy Roman Empire.
The lineage includes numerous cardinals, viceroys of Sicily and a saint, Giuseppe Pignatelli di Fuentes (1737–1811), canonized in 1954 by Pius XII .
The inheritances in titles and affiliations of three great European genealogies gradually flowed into the family, the Aragona, the Tagliavia and the Cortés, so much so that in the end the representatives of the family bore all four surnames: "Pignatelli Aragona Tagliavia Cortés".
