The following is a list of characters from the Australian television series Wentworth.


== Main characters ==


=== Bea Smith ===

Bea Smith (Danielle Cormack) (seasons 1–4) came to be an inmate after attempting to murder her husband, Harry, after she had endured years of domestic violence. After entering the facility, she is coveted by both Franky Doyle and Jacs Holt in their fight for "Top Dog" of the prison. Bea struggles adjusting to her new life in prison as well as trying to keep up with her daughter, Debbie, and her husband while they are in the outside world. After Bea's daughter is murdered on the order of Jacs Holt, Bea kills her by jabbing a pen into her neck and is charged with manslaughter. After believing that Debbie committed suicide, it is later revealed to Bea that Debbie was murdered by Brayden Holt, Jacs' son. Hellbent on revenge, Bea concocts a plan to escape Wentworth and kill Brayden for killing Debbie. After a bloody fight with Franky, Bea slices her own wrists, as sliced wrists cannot be cuffed, and is transferred to the hospital, where she escapes after being treated. Bea finds Brayden and holds him hostage in his mechanic shop, where she gets him to confess to killing Debbie, after which she kills him. Bea is charged with murder and returns to Wentworth as the new "Top Dog".  She maintains a tough anti-drug trafficking policy with inmates. During a fire started by Ferguson, after killing Jess, Bea saves Doreen's baby and Franky.  Bea is serving life without parole. Loneliness, the loss of Debbie and the stress of being "Top Dog" take their toll on Bea over time. Season four widely focuses on Bea discovering a side of herself she never believed to be there after falling in love with new inmate Allie Novak. In the finale of season 4, Bea believes Allie to be dead after she was given a hotshot (a lethal amount of illicit drugs) by Joan Ferguson. As Joan is walking out of the prison following her release, Bea confronts her with a screwdriver. After a struggle ensues between the two, Joan gains control of the screwdriver and Bea impales herself onto it 8 times, followed by a further 5 stab wounds from Joan herself, which cause Bea's death and ensure that Joan cannot be released from Wentworth and will be forced to remain in custody until her trial.

During season 3, Fletcher spends his time recovering from his attack, which leaves him both physically injured and with severe mental damage and amnesia. Will visits to finally put their past behind them. Vera also comes to visit him during his rehab, which is later discovered by Ferguson. After a severe bout of depression and alcoholism, Vera gives him advice that helps him start to get back on track, and Ferguson and Channing offer him his job back in an attempt to discover what he still remembers.

He attacks her, giving her a blow to the head, and robs her, for which he is arrested, though the blow to her head gives her amnesia.
