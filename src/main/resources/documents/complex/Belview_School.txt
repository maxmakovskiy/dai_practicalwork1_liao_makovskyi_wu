============================================================

The Belview School is a historic building in Macon County, Tennessee, United States.
The school was built by Leo Butrum in 1936, and the first teacher was Lewis Bandy. It was named for Mr Belview, a teacher from Kentucky who taught at the original Belview School on Puncheon Creek Road in the 1890s. The school closed down circa 1959, and it was later used as a community meeting place. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since March 21, 2007.
It was built to a standard plan for a two-teacher rural schoolhouse.
