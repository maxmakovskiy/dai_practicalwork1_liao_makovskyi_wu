Falkirk played a significant role in the Industrial Revolution, particularly in the iron and steel industry, supported by the Carron Company in nearby Carron. While heavy industry has declined in the last fifty years, Falkirk's economy now relies on retail and tourism. The town is home to international companies like Alexander Dennis, the largest bus production company in the UK.

The town's history is traced back to the Scottish Gaelic name "An Eaglais Bhreac," meaning "variegated church," which evolved into the Scots name "Fawkirk" and later to the modern English name "Falkirk." The Latin name Varia Capella also carries the same meaning. Falkirk has a long history, with its Old Parish Church potentially founded as early as the 7th century.



The Antonine Wall, similar to Hadrian's Wall, passed through Falkirk, marking the northern frontier of the Roman Empire. Evidence of Roman occupation, including a hoard of Roman coins and a tartan cloth thought to be the oldest recorded, has been found in Falkirk.



The town played a crucial role in Scotland's Industrial Revolution, with significant developments in the iron-casting industry, canal construction, and early railway development. Falkirk also witnessed two important battles: the Battle of Falkirk in 1298, where William Wallace was defeated by King Edward I of England, and the Battle of Falkirk Muir in 1746, where Jacobites under Charles Edward Stuart defeated a government army.

Falkirk F.C.



Falkirk Football Club is a Scottish professional football club currently playing in the Scottish Premier League.



In the club's early years, a wide number of pitches and stadia were used. In 1885, the site of Brockville Park in Falkirk was leased, and there the club remained until the last day of the 2002-03 season. Due to Brockville's central location in the town, and the SPL's stringent stadium requirements, the dilapidated Brockville site, home of Falkirk for over 100 years, was no longer suitable for the club's ambitions. For season 2003-04, the club groundshared with Stenhousemuir at Ochilview stadium on the outskirts of the town. At the start of 2004-05 they moved into their new purpose built stadium which meets SPL criteria. The ground currently consists of two stands with a third due to start in the coming months.



The old Brockville ground was demolished in 2003/2004 and the land is now home to a branch of the Morrisons supermarket, which has several items of Falkirk F.C. memorabilia on site, including a turnstile from the old ground.
