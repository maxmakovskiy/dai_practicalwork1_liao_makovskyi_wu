============================================================

Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, known as Orrick, is a global law firm serving clients primarily in the technology, energy, infrastructure, finance, life sciences, and health tech sectors. Founded in 1863, in San Francisco, California, where it maintains headquarters; it has offices in over 25 international markets.


== History ==


=== Founding and First 100 Years ===
The firm traces its origins to the 1863 organization of the German Savings and Loan Society (later joined to First Interstate Bank of California), with John R. Jarboe as general counsel. Jarboe and partners W.S. Goodfellow and Ralph C. Harrison, later dissolved San Francisco firm, Jarboe, Harrison & Goodfellow in 1891, following Harrison's election as justice to the California Supreme Court. Jarboe died two years later at age 57, in poor health. Goodfellow subsequently joined Charles Eells to form Goodfellow & Eell. Ells helped organize the Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company, in the aftermath of the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906. William H. Orrick joined the firm in 1910, followed by George Herrington and Eric Sutcliffe.
Orrick's earliest work included funding Golden Gate Bridge construction; shaping the California Corporate Securities Act; the first offerings under the Securities Act of 1933; and litigating over hydroelectric power and water development rights in the Lake Tahoe region.


=== Global Expansion and Strategic Growth ===
In the 1980s, the firm expanded outside of the Bay Area, establishing offices in New York City and Los Angeles. It opened its first international offices in Tokyo, during the late 1990s; London and Paris offices were added in 2002, along with its "Global Operations Center" in Wheeling, WV.
Orrick acquired 40 lawyers and their litigation practices from Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine in 1998.
In 2003, the firm added a team from the Venture Law Group (VLG). In 2005, Orrick expanded its London office and opened offices in Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai with alumni of subsequently defunct law firm Coudert Brothers.
In 2006, the firm engaged in merger negotiations with legacy Wall Street firm Dewey Ballantine; the merger was unsuccessful. The same year, Orrick expanded its Paris office through a combination with Rambaud Martel, a M&A and dispute resolution firm in France.
In 2008, Orrick expanded into Germany by combining with Hölters & Elsing (Partnerschaft von Rechtsanwälten); today, the firm has offices in Düsseldorf and Munich. That year, the firm admitted almost two dozen partners in its London, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C., offices from the San Francisco firm Heller Ehrman, including 27 hired after Heller's September 26, 2008, announcement of dissolution.

Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overruled Roe v. Wade.
In 2023, Orrick merged with AmLaw 200 Buckley. This grew Orrick's financial regulation, enforcement, and litigation services, and doubled the firm's footprint in Washington. D.C. The combination expanded Orrick's offerings to consumer banks, fintechs, and the payment arms of major global tech players.
