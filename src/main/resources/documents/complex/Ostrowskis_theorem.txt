============================================================

In number theory, Ostrowski's theorem, due to Alexander Ostrowski (1916), states that every non-trivial absolute value on the rational numbers 
  
    
      
        
          Q
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} }
  
 is equivalent to either the usual real absolute value or a p-adic absolute value.

An absolute value on the rational numbers is a function

    {\displaystyle |x|^{\lambda }}

          Q

 is the standard absolute value on the reals, defined to be

        x

            ∞

        x

          p

    {\displaystyle x=p^{n}{\tfrac {a}{b}}}
  
, where a and b are coprime integers not divisible by p, and n is an integer; so we define

== Proof ==
The following proof follows the one of Theorem 10.1 in Schikhof (2007).
Let 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        ⋅
        
          
            |
          
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\cdot |_{*}}
  
 be an absolute value on the rationals. We start the proof by showing that it is entirely determined by the values it takes on prime numbers.
From the fact that 
  
    
      
        1
        ×
        1
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1\times 1=1}
  
 and the multiplicativity property of the absolute value, we infer that 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        1
        
          
            |
          
          
            ∗
          
          
            2
          
        
        =
        
          |
        
        1
        
          
            |

    {\displaystyle |1|_{*}^{2}=|1|_{*}}
  
. In particular,

            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |1|_{*}}

        1
        ≠
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1\neq 0}
  
, one must have

. A similar argument shows that

        −
        1

    {\displaystyle |-1|_{*}=1}
  
. 
For all positive integer n, the multiplicativity property entails

        −
        n

        =
        
          |
        
        −
        1

            ∗
          
        
        ×
        
          |
        
        n
        
          
            |
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        =

        n

    {\displaystyle |-n|_{*}=|-1|_{*}\times |n|_{*}=|n|_{*}}
  
. In other words, the absolute value of a negative integer coincides with that of its opposite.
Let n be a positive integer. From the fact that 
  
    
      
        
          n
          
            −

        n
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle n^{-1}\times n=1}
  
 and the multiplicativity property, we conclude that 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        
          n

            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |n^{-1}|_{*}=|n|_{*}^{-1}}
  
.
Let now r be a positive rational. There exist two coprime positive integers p and q such that 
  
    
      
        r
        =
        p
        
          q
          
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle r=pq^{-1}}
  
. The properties above show that 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        r

        =

            ∗

            1
          
        
        
          
            |
          
          
            ∗
          
        
        =

            ∗
          
          
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |r|_{*}=|p|_{*}|q^{-1}|_{*}=|p|_{*}|q|_{*}^{-1}}
  
. Altogether, the absolute value of a positive rational is entirely determined from that of its numerator and denominator.
Finally, let 
  
    
      
        
          P
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {P} }
  
 be the set of prime numbers. For all positive integer n, we can write

  
    
      
        n
        =
        
          ∏
          
            p
            ∈
            
              P
            
          
        
        
          p
          
            
              v
              
                p
              
            
            (
            n
            )
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle n=\prod _{p\in \mathbb {P} }p^{v_{p}(n)},}
  

where 
  
    
      
        
          v
          
            p
          
        
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle v_{p}(n)}
  
 is the p-adic valuation of n. The multiplicativity property enables one to compute the absolute value of n from that of the prime numbers using the following relationship

  
    
      
        
          |
        
        n

                  p
                  ∈
                  
                    P

                  (
                  n
                  )
                
              
            
            |

        =
        
          ∏
          
            p
            ∈
            
              P

            (
            n

    {\displaystyle |n|_{*}=\left|\prod _{p\in \mathbb {P} }p^{v_{p}(n)}\right|_{*}=\prod _{p\in \mathbb {P} }|p|_{*}^{v_{p}(n)}.}
  

We continue the proof by separating two cases:

There exists a positive integer n such that 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        n

        >
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle |n|_{*}>1}
  
; or
For all integer n, one has

. Because the triangle inequality implies that for all positive integers n we have

        n

    {\displaystyle |n|_{*}\leq n}

        0
        <
        λ
        ≤
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0<\lambda \leq 1}
  
.
As per the above result on the determination of an absolute value by its values on the prime numbers, we easily see that

        r

        r

            λ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |r|_{*}=|r|_{\infty }^{\lambda }}
  
 for all rational r, thus demonstrating equivalence to the real absolute value.


=== Second case ===
Suppose that for all integer n, one has 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        n

            ∗
          
        
        ≤
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle |n|_{*}\leq 1}
  
. As our absolute value is non-trivial, there must exist a positive integer n for which 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        n
        
          
            |

        1.
      
    
    {\displaystyle |n|_{*}<1.}
  
 Decomposing

            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |n|_{*}}
  
 on the prime numbers shows that there exists 
  
    
      
        p
        ∈
        
          P
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\in \mathbb {P} }
  
 such that 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        p

        <
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle |p|_{*}<1}
  
. We claim that in fact this is so for one prime number only.
Suppose by way of contradiction that p and q are two distinct primes with absolute value strictly less than 1. Let k be a positive integer such that 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        p

            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |p|_{*}^{k}}
  
 and

            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |q|_{*}^{k}}
  
 are smaller than 
  
    
      
        1
        
          /
        
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1/2}
  
. By Bézout's identity, since 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            k

 and

            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle q^{k}}
  
 are coprime, there exist two integers a and b such that 
  
    
      
        a
        
          p

        =
        1.
      
    
    {\displaystyle ap^{k}+bq^{k}=1.}
  
 This yields a contradiction, as

    {\displaystyle 1=|1|_{*}\leq |a|_{*}|p|_{*}^{k}+|b|_{*}|q|_{*}^{k}<{\frac {|a|_{*}+|b|_{*}}{2}}\leq 1.}
  

This means that there exists a unique prime p such that

        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle |q|_{*}=1}
  
 (from the hypothesis of this second case). Let 
  
    
      
        λ
        =
        −
        
          log

. (And indeed in this case, all positive

    {\displaystyle \lambda }
  
 give absolute values equivalent to the p-adic one.)
We finally verify that

    {\displaystyle |r|_{*}=|r|_{p}^{\lambda }}
  
 for all rational r, implying that this absolute value is equivalent to the p-adic one.

== Another Ostrowski's theorem ==
Another theorem states that any field, complete with respect to an Archimedean absolute value, is (algebraically and topologically) isomorphic to either the real numbers or the complex numbers. This is sometimes also referred to as Ostrowski's theorem.
